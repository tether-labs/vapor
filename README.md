# Fabric 🚧 Under heavy development 🚧

Fabric is a modern, lightweight framework for building fast, memory-efficient applications with Zig. Fabric 
can be combined with any renderer to generate various application types, including web, native, and even mobile apps.

A modern, lightweight web framework for building WebAssembly applications with Zig. 
Fabric enables developers to create fast, efficient web applications by compiling Zig code directly to WebAssembly, 
bringing systems programming performance to the browser.

## ✨ Features

- **WebAssembly Support**: Compile Fabric to a 60kb WebAssembly binary uncompressed
- **Zig Native**: Leverages Zig's safety, performance, and compile-time guarantees
- **Component System**: Modular architecture for building reusable UI components
- **Theme Support**: Built-in theming system for consistent styling
- **Hot Reload**: Development-friendly with auto-rebuild capabilities
- **WASI Compatible**: Supports WebAssembly System Interface for enhanced capabilities

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) (latest stable version)
- Basic knowledge of Zig programming

### Installation

1. **Install Zig** (recommended: use [ZVM](https://www.zvm.app/) for version management)
2. [Learn Zig](https://www.openmymind.net/learning_zig/language_overview_1/)

# Install Fabric CLI

Run this command to install fabric-cli on your macOS (Apple Silicon):

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vic-Rokx/fabric-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

## What this does:

- Downloads the latest version of fabric-cli
- Installs it to `/usr/local/bin/fabric`
- Makes it executable and available in your PATH

## Requirements:

- macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
- Administrator privileges (for `sudo` during installation)

After installation, you can run:

```bash
metal fabric --help
```

```bash
metal fabric create myapp
```

### Core Concepts

#### Fabric Instance

The global Fabric instance manages your application state and rendering:

```zig
var fb: fabric.lib = undefined;
```

#### Render Cycle

Fabric uses a render cycle approach for updating the UI:

```zig
export fn renderCommands(route_ptr: [*:0]u8) i32 {
    const route = std.mem.span(route_ptr);
    fabric.renderCycle(route);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Memory Management

Fabric is designed to work with WebAssembly's memory model:

```zig
pub fn main() !void {
    // Use WASM allocator for optimal performance
    allocator = std.heap.wasm_allocator;
}
```

### Component System

Fabric provides a component-based architecture for building reusable UI elements:

```zig
// Example component structure
const MyComponent = struct {
    // Component state
    title: []const u8,
    visible: bool = true,

    // Component methods
    pub fn render(self: *MyComponent) void {
        // Rendering logic here
    }

    pub fn update(self: *MyComponent) void {
        // Update logic here
    }
};
```
## 🛠️ Development

```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Build Options

Fabric supports various build configurations:

```zig
// Optimize for size (recommended for web)
.preferred_optimize_mode = .ReleaseSmall,
```

### Target Options

```zig
// Standard WebAssembly with WASI
.default_target = .{ .cpu_arch = .wasm32, .os_tag = .wasi },
```

## 📊 Performance

Fabric is designed for optimal WebAssembly performance:

- **Small Bundle Size**: Base wasm is 40kb 
- **Fast Startup**: Quick initialization times
- **Efficient Memory**: Careful memory management for WASM constraints
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Zig's compile-time optimizations
